### Biography

My name is Ruidong Li, a Bioinformatics Research Scientist at [Gilead Sciences, Inc.](https://www.gilead.com/) in the Bay Area in California, USA. 

During my Ph.D. study in the [Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics (GGB) Program](https://ggb.ucr.edu/) at [Univeristy of California, Riverside (UCR)](https://www.ucr.edu/), I developed two R/Bioconductor pacakges: [GDCRNATools](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/GDCRNATools.html)  for integrative analysis of multi-omics data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/) ([Li et al., Bioinformatics, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty124)), and [Hapi](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hapi/vignettes/Hapi.html) for whole-genome haplotype inference using single reproductive cell sequencing ([Li et al., Molecular Biology and Evolution, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa176)). I also developed a statistical method called [SFS-BLUPH](https://github.com/rli012/BLUPHAT), which adopted the widely used genomic prediction/genomic selection model - Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) in plant and animal breeding to search multi-omics data for prognostic signatures of cancer ([Li et al., Briefings in Bioinformatics, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa197)). A web server [CancerMIRNome](http://bioinfo.jialab-ucr.org/CancerMIRNome/) for comprehensive analysis and visualization of cancer miRNome data including TCGA miRNome and circulating cancer miRNome has recently been online, and the preprint of the manuscript is now on bioRxiv ([Li et al., bioRxiv, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.04.325670)) 

I've also collaborated with biologists on many different projects. Some of the works have also been published in high impact journals, including [Plant Biotechnology Journal](https://doi.org/10.1111/pbi.13170), [Briefings in Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa244),  [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa345), and [Cell Host & Microbe](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/home). Please feel free to email me at *rli012@ucr.edu* or add my wechat *rli012* if you are interested in collaborations.
